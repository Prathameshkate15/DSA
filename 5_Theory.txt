Problem Statement:
To understand and implement threaded binary search trees, including inorder threading and traversal without recursion or stack.

Objectives:
1. To understand the structure and advantages of threaded binary trees.
2. To implement inorder traversal using threads.

Outcomes:
1. Students will be able to represent binary trees with threads.
2. Students will be able to perform inorder traversal without using a stack or recursion.

Software Requirements:
1. Python Programming Environment
2. IDE/Text Editor like VS Code
3. 64-bit Operating System

Theory:
In a normal binary tree, many pointers are NULL. Threaded binary trees use these NULL pointers to point to inorder predecessor or successor. This allows traversal without recursion or a stack.

Types:
- Single Threaded: Each node is threaded towards either left or right (but not both).
- Double Threaded: Each node is threaded towards both left and right.

Advantages:
- Saves space by reusing NULL pointers.
- Faster inorder traversal.
- Efficient memory usage.

Algorithm for Inorder Traversal (Threaded BST):
1. Start from the leftmost node.
2. While the current node is not NULL:
   a) Print data.
   b) Move to inorder successor.

Conclusion:
Threaded binary trees provide an efficient way to traverse binary trees without additional memory. Understanding and implementing threaded trees strengthens the understanding of advanced tree structures.
